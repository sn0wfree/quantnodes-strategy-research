"""Backtest validation toolkit (P3-c).

Three independent statistical checks:
  - Monte Carlo permutation test (path significance)
  - Bootstrap Sharpe confidence interval (Sharpe stability)
  - Walk-Forward analysis (regime consistency)

Plus a multi-market registry (MarketType) for future per-market algorithm
support. In v0.3.0 only A_SHARE / HK_EQUITY / US_EQUITY are validated;
other markets emit a UserWarning and fall back to A_SHARE defaults.
