"""Progress emission channel for long-running tools.

The structured-progress half (``emit_progress`` / ``_set_emitter`` /
``ProgressEvent``) was removed in P1.5-c (DELETE-CANDIDATE B3 executed):
the agent loop injects progress via ``loop.py._progress_callback`` and
nothing consumed the thread-local emitter. What remains is the
tool-level heartbeat: a background timer that fires keepalive events
every N seconds while a tool runs, so the UI never looks frozen.
Driven by the agent loop, opaque to the tool. Tests: test_progress.py.
