"""LoopContext — shared state passed between LoopStrategy steps.

P1-1 introduces a composable ``LoopStrategy`` whose ``Step``
implementations exchange state through this context. Defaults are
chosen so v0.1 callers can build a fresh context in one line.

L7 adds ``result`` and ``hook_ctx`` fields so steps can read the
in-flight AgentLoop result / hook context without a separate
``metadata`` lookup.
