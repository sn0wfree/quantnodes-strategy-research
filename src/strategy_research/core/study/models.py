"""Data models for the study task system.

A study is a long-horizon, goal-driven automation of the autoresearch
loop. The ledger layer (GoalStore) tracks the research objective,
acceptance criteria and evidence; this module tracks the *execution*
state (queued / running / paused / error ...) plus the binding to a
workspace + strategy that the autoresearch loop drives.
