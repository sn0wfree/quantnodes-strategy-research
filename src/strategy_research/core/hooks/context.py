"""Hook context — mutable per-iteration state shared across AgentHook invocations.

Adapted from llmwikify foundation/callback/context.py (MIT License).
Original: https://github.com/llmwikify/llmwikify

One AgentHookContext instance is created per Runner.run() call and mutated
in-place as the runner progresses through the agent loop. All registered
hooks receive the same context object, so per-iteration state (tool_calls,
usage, streamed_content flags, etc.) is observable across the fan-out.
