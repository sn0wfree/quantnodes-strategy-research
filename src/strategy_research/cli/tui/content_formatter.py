"""Content formatting for assistant messages before Markdown rendering.

The LLM frequently emits structured JSON as part of its response. When
this JSON is passed directly to Rich's ``Markdown`` renderer, it is
treated as paragraph text — no syntax highlighting, no word-wrap at
meaningful boundaries, and the result looks like a wall of garbled
characters.

This module detects JSON-like content in the body and wraps it in a
fenced `````json``` `` code block so the Markdown renderer applies
monokai syntax highlighting and natural word-wrap at punctuation /
whitespace boundaries.

Detection heuristic:
    * The content contains ``{`` followed by ``": `` (a JSON key-value
      pair indicator).
    * Everything from the first ``{`` to end-of-string is treated as
      the JSON body and wrapped in a fenced block.
    * A preceding markdown prefix (e.g. ``> blockquote``) is split out
      and rendered as its own Markdown paragraph.

If the JSON is incomplete (truncated mid-stream by the LLM), the code
block still renders — Rich shows what it can and the user can scroll.

    If the content contains a JSON-like block (detected by ``{``
    followed by ``": ``), split it into:

        1. A markdown prefix (everything before the first ``{``).
        2. A fenced `````json``` `` code block (everything from ``{``
           to end-of-string).

    The prefix is rendered as its own Markdown paragraph (preserving
    blockquotes, headers, lists, etc.). The JSON block gets monokai
    syntax highlighting and natural word-wrap.

    Args:
        content: Raw body text from the LLM (after think-tag extraction).

        detected, the original content is returned unchanged.
