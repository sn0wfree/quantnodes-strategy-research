"""EventBusV2 — event publisher with 3 sinks (Level 3, B4 commit 1).

.. deprecated::
    Use ``EventStore`` (``strategy_research.core.agent.event_store``) instead.
    EventBusV2 is kept for backward compatibility but no longer imported
    by service.py or chat.py. Will be removed in a future release.

This module sits between the producers (AgentLoop, service.py) and
three sinks:
   1. event_log table (persistence — the source of truth)
   2. Legacy EventBus (live SSE delivery to connected clients)
   3. Projector.flush() — materializes events to messages + message_parts
      tables (B4: the only write path for those tables)

In B4, service.py stops writing directly to messages/message_parts.
Instead, it emits events via EventBusV2. EventBusV2 persists to
event_log, then calls Projector.flush() to update messages +
message_parts tables (which become materialized views).

Why three sinks:
- event_log: append-only source of truth, replayable, auditable
- Legacy EventBus: live SSE delivery to connected clients (kept for
  backward compat with existing SSE endpoint)
- Projector.flush: materialized view in messages + message_parts,
  readable by existing code paths that haven't switched to projector

In B4, EventBusV2 is a drop-in replacement for EventBus in the
service.py constructor. It implements emit() with the same
signature, auto-assigns seq numbers per session, and writes to
all three sinks.
