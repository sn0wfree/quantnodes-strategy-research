"""Tests for FastAPI lifespan wiring — recover_on_startup must run.

The scheduler's ``recover_on_startup`` method itself is covered in
``tests/test_study_scheduler.py``. Here we verify the lifespan hook
actually invokes it during ``create_app`` so that uvicorn reload / process
restart does not leave RUNNING/QUEUED studies stranded.
