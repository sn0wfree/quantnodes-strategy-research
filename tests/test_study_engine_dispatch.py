"""Tests for study engine dispatch + plan-dag async wiring.

Originally lived in tests/test_study_dag_engine.py together with the
dag-engine golden-output tests (now archived to attic/). Only the dispatch
-tests + plan-dag async test remain — they verify the live dispatch
contract: the phases graph path is the only executor; legacy engine
values ('dag', 'langgraph') pass through unchanged and fall back to
phases with a warning (P5-2).
