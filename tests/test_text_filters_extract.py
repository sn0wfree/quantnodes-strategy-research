"""Tests for ``extract_thinking_tags`` — (think, body) splitter.

Covered cases:
  * Empty / None input
  * Single closed tag (5 variants)
  * Multiple closed tags
  * Self-closing marker
  * Unclosed (truncated) tag
  * Mixed closed + unclosed
  * Think content stripped of whitespace
  * Body content stripped of whitespace
  * No tags — passthrough
  * Tag-like content inside code blocks NOT extracted
    (defensive: we only match exact tag delimiters)
  * Multiple think sections joined with ``\\n\\n``
  * Whitespace-only think content not added
