"""Tests for SSE heartbeat behavior.

The heartbeat mechanism prevents the browser's EventSource from
reporting onerror on idle streams. The first yield of every
event_generator must be a comment line so StreamingResponse flushes
headers immediately, and subsequent heartbeats must be comment lines
so they don't pollute the frontend's switch statement.
